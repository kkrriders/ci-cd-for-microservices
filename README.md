# ci-cd-for-microservices
This project automates the development and deployment of microservices using a CI/CD pipeline. It builds, tests, and deploys code changes automatically, reducing errors and speeding up releases. Each microservice can be updated independently, ensuring reliable, up-to-date software without manual intervention.
